                    <p>On the first day, I went to the orthodontist. 
                        <br>
                        I'm <i>almost</i> done with my Invisalign treatment, but they still want to make some corrections.
                        <br>
                        I have my next appointment <strong>6 weeks from today</strong> and I need to make sure I don't miss it.

                    <p>I also played some VR games; mostly Eleven Table Tennis. <br>
                        I got <b>destroyed</b> by one player, but made friends with another.

                    <p>As expected, I'm doing my classes as well. In order of difficulty right now, I'd say its:</p>

                        This day was a little less eventful. I finished a quiz for CSE 110, and I excedded my expectations.

                        I also played a little Super Mario 3D World. This is where I am in the game so far:

                    <p>
                        I hung out with a friend of mine, and we went for sandwiches at Firehouse Subs and hung out at Best Buy.

                        I <b>love</b> the beef and chedder brisket there, but I didn't get it today because I wanted to try something different.

                        I worked on this website today, and refreshed some of the html skills I've gotten rusty on.
                        <br>
                        I'm really looking forward to integrating css and js into my pages!
